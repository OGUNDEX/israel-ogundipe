This repository hosts a static, performance-first site documenting real-world web
performance optimization work.

## Focus Areas
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS)
- Media delivery optimization
- Script execution and render-path analysis
- Infrastructure decoupling (Cloudflare R2)
- WordPress and page-builder performance remediation

## Live Site

## Why Static
This site is intentionally built using plain HTML and CSS to:
- Minimize latency and attack surface
- Avoid unnecessary runtime overhead
- Demonstrate performance discipline and engineering judgment
